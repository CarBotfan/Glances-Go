# Contributing to Glances-Go

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Glances-Go! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This is one of the simplest and most effective ways to contribute. If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/srini-abhiram/glances-go/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/srini-abhiram/glances-go/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "enhancement" label. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement, why it's needed, and how it would work.

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

#### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two/one other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

Thank you for your contribution!
